# driver-drowsiness-detection
A driver drowsiness detection project aims to detect when a driver is drowsy or inattentive while driving, in order to prevent accidents caused by driver’s sleep
1. The project uses a webcam to capture images of the driver and apply deep learning algorithms to recognize drowsiness
2. The project can also detect the eye region of the driver to detect fatigue or drowsiness
3. The project can use OpenCV to gather images from a webcam and feed them into a Deep Learning model to classify whether the person’s eyes are open or closed
