# driver-drowsiness-detection
The driver drowsiness detection project focuses on identifying instances of driver fatigue or in attention during vehicle operation, aiming to enhance road safety and prevent accidents caused by driver drowsiness. The key components of the project include:
Utilizing a webcam to capture real-time images of the driver.
Employing deep learning algorithms to analyze the eye region of the driver for signs of fatigue or drowsiness.
Leveraging OpenCV to acquire images from the webcam and inputting them into a deep learning model.
Implementing a mechanism that triggers an alarm sound when the model classifies the driver's eyes as closed for a specific duration, alerting the driver to their drowsy state.
